#In k-fold cross-validation, the original sample is randomly partitioned into k equal 
#sized subsamples. Of the k subsamples, a single subsample is retained as the validation 
#data for testing the model, and the remaining k âˆ’ 1 subsamples are used as training data. 
#The cross-validation process is then repeated k times (the folds), with each of the k 
#subsamples used exactly once as the validation data. The k results from the folds can 
#then be averaged to produce a single estimation. The advantage of this method over 
#repeated random sub-sampling (see below) is that all observations are used for both 
#training and validation, and each observation is used for validation exactly once. 
#10-fold cross-validation is commonly used,[6] but in general k remains an unfixed 
#parameter.
